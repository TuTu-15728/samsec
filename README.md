    3. Journal: Finally, the Journal is where they see your latest thoughts, updates, and reflections.

Right Side (Impact -> Process -> Tools):

    2. Writeups: Once they're impressed by your projects, they'll naturally ask, "How does she think?" The Writeups show your problem-solving process and analytical skills.
