Left Side (Theory -> Practice -> Reflection):

    1. Academy: This is the starting point. A new visitor looking to learn will naturally look here first. It's the foundation of all your knowledge.

    2. Guides: After learning the basics in the Academy, the next step is to follow a practical, step-by-step Guide. This creates a perfect flow from theory to application.

    3. Journal: Finally, the Journal is where they see your latest thoughts, updates, and reflections.

Right Side (Impact -> Process -> Tools):

    1. Projects: This is your biggest impact. Showcasing your finished Projects first is like leading with your strongest hand. It immediately demonstrates your capability and builds credibility.

    2. Writeups: Once they're impressed by your projects, they'll naturally ask, "How does she think?" The Writeups show your problem-solving process and analytical skills.

    3. Snippets: Finally, Snippets are the useful tools and code blocks that others can use. It's a fantastic resource, but it has the most niche appeal, making it perfect for the last spot.
